  3) since the check orders Cron runs every minute, we need to optimize this for bulk order processing
      ideally we get the max and min price for each instrument, and check whether trigger has fallen within this
      (this will work when we have updates to instruments every second, but may miss spikey orders...)
  4) add apis to get stuff:
      User's balance, used margin - Done
      Current open trades
      Current open orders
      Historic trades
  6) add authentication to API calls
  7) additional functionality
      User management (CRUD)
      Leagues
      Groups
      Emails
      reset account
  8) Margin calls - BANKRUPT! if balance goes less than 0 when considering all remaining open trades
      Maybe limit max lot size and margin to keep this not too easy to do
